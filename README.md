# GitHub Commands for Version Control

This README provides a summary of some essential GitHub commands for version control.

## 1. Git Basics

- **git init:** Initializes a new Git repository in your local directory.

- **git add <filename>** or **git add .** (dot): Adds files to the staging area for the next commit.

- **git commit -m "<message>"**: Creates a commit with a descriptive message to record changes to the repository.

- **git status**: Shows the current status of your working directory, including untracked and staged files.

## 2. Collaboration and Remote Repositories

- **git remote add <name> <url>**: Adds a remote repository (e.g., your GitHub repository) to your local one. Replace `<name>` with a chosen nickname and `<url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

- **git push -u origin main**: Pushes your local commits to the remote repository's `main` branch. Replace `origin` with the remote nickname you used in the previous command.

- **git clone <url>**: Clones (downloads) a remote repository to your local machine. Replace `<url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

## 3. Additional Commands

- **git branch <branch_name>**: Creates a new branch.

- **git checkout <branch_name>**: Switches to an existing branch.

- **git merge <branch_name>**: Merges a branch into the current branch.

- **git pull origin main**: Fetches changes from the remote `main` branch and integrates them into your local branch.

- **git log**: Shows the commit history of your repository.

**Note:** Refer to the official GitHub documentation (https://docs.github.com/en) for detailed explanations and usage examples of these commands.
